/**
 * Type representing any [JSON][1] object.
 *
 * This type can be useful to enforce some input to be JSON-compatible or as a
 * super-type to be extended from.
 *
 * Don't use this as a direct return type as the user would have to double-cast
 * it: `object as unknown as CustomResponse`.
 *
 * Instead, you could extend `JSONObject` to ensure your type only uses
 * JSON-compatible types:  `interface CustomResponse extends JSONObject { â€¦ }`.
